MBA is rather a single algorithm than a library. It is developed for
making surfaces from scattered data points. The algorithm works at
different levels, and can be used both for small and large point
sets. Compared to similar methods it is extremely fast. The code is
implemented in C++.

This software was written by the Geometry Group at SINTEF ICT,
