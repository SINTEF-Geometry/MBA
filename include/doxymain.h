//! <a name="intro"><h2>Short introduction</h2></a>
//! This documentation contains a brief reference manual for the
//! <b>SINTEF</b> <b>Multilevel</b> <b>B-spline</b> <b>Library</b>
//! developed at <a
//! href="http://www.sintef.no/content/page3____342.aspx">SINTEF
//! Applied Mathematics</a>. The main interface is through the class
//! <a class="el" href="classMBA.html">MBA</a> which also contains a
//! small example in its documentation. Note that only the
//! non-adaptive/non-parametric version of the algorithms are
//! documented here. Parametric and adaptive versions, as used to
//! generate the head-model in the figure above, are implemented in
//! the classes MBApar (parametric), MBAadaptive (adaptive) and
//! MBAadaptivePar (adaptive and parametric).
//! <p>
//! For a thorough description of the basic schemes, the papers by the
//! originators of Multilevel B-splines, S. Lee, G. Wolberg and
//! S. Y. Shin, should be consulted.
//! <p>
//! A detailed description of the mathematical content of the
//! algorithms, with extensions made in the SINTEF library and with
//! numerical examples, can be found in the report:<br>
//! <em>Ø. Hjelle. Approximation of Scattered Data with Multilevel
//! B-splines. SINTEF report, 2001.</em><br>

//! <a name="gettingstarted"><h2>Getting started</h2></a>
//! It's very easy - just look at the small <a class="el"
//! href="classMBA.html#mba_example1">example</a> in class <a
//! class="el" href="classMBA.html">MBA</a> and read the documentation
//! for the functions that are called there. Then, copy the complete
//! <a href="mainsimplest.html#mainsimplest">main program</a> to a
//! file - compile it and run it! The program samples the resulting
//! spline surface and writes the result to a VRML-file. You can
//! download a free VRML-viewer from <a
//! href="http://www.km.kongsberg.com/sim">Kongsberg SIM</a>.
//! <p>
//! If you have got the Visual C++ workspace with all the source code,
//! then you can just build the application and run it with the
//! current main program.
//! <p>
//! <a name="examples"><h2>Numerical examples</h2></a>
//! I will make numerical examples and discuss pros and cons
//! thoroughly later. Consult the SINTEF report for mathematical
//! details.
//! <p>
//! <a name="furtherWork"><h2>Further work</h2></a>
//! Note that the basic algorithms in this library does not solve "the
//! scattered data approximation problem" in general. The algorithms
//! will produce anomalies near the data if the underlying grid of
//! B-spline coefficients is dense and the data points are unevenly
//! distributed in the domain. The remedy, as far as I have concluded
//! through numerical experiments, is to combine the basic schemes
//! with smoothing operators. This is now being implemented and will
//! be available in the next version.
//! <p>
//! <a name="download"><h2>Download</h2></a> 
//! A GPL-version of the library (for Linux/Unix) can be downloaded from <a
