/** \brief \b Main \b interaface \b for \b multilevel \b B-spline \b approximation
 *
 * MBA - Multilevel B-spline approximation (and interpolation).
 * This is the main interface to multilevel B-spline approximation of scattered
 * data for functional surfaces. The method is based on B-spline refinement
 * and produces one single B-spline surface, as opposed to MBAadaptive that
 * produces a hierarchy of spline surfaces.
 * The domain of the surface will be the rectangular domain of the given scattered
 * data in the (x,y)-axes directions as default.
 * (We use \em u and \em v for \em x and \em y in function headers)
 * The function MBA::MBAalg produces the spline surface from the scattered data.
 * The spline surface can be retrieved as a SplineSurface object with
 * MBA::getSplineSurface.
 * Note that this is a (mathematical) lower level interface; thus there is no check
 * for the validity of given scattered data or of arguments passed to
 * member functions.
 *
 * \anchor mba_example1
 * Examle of use (minimal):
 * \code

   double z = surf.f(x,y);            // evaluate (height of) surface in (x,y)
   surf.normalVector(x,y, nx,ny,nz);  // evaluate normal vector in (x,y)
