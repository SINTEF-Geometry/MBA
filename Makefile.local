# The libdirs should be organized like this: /SI......../lib/ should
# contain one subdir for every platform (sgi [or IRIX for some globals, hp-pa 
# [or hp-aCC for global libs], winnt etc.). Each of these should contain the
# nopt/ and opt/ subdirs.
#
# Global is really a bad name, it only applies to siscat/latools/etc. stuff
