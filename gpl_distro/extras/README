This is an implementation of the Multilevel B-spline Algorithm, as
described by

"S. Lee, G. Wolberg, and S. Y. Shin. Scattered data interpolation with
multilevel B-splines. IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer
Graphics, 3(3):229--244, 1997."

The code is copyrighted by SINTEF ICT, Applied Mathematics, and

To make the library, type 'make' or 'make lib' at the command prompt.
(The library file will be saved in the 'lib' directory).  It has only
been tested for linux users using the g++ compiler.

The code itself should be compilable with Microsoft Visual C++, but
you will have to set up your own project.  Alternatively, cygwin might
work using the present makefile.

If you have Doxygen installed, you can generate documentation by
typing 'doxygen' at the command prompt.  The documentation can also be
found on-line at:
