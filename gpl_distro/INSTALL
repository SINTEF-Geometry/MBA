Installation Instructions
*************************

This GoTools package uses CMake to generate a Makefile (on Linux) or
MS Visual Studio project file (on Windows).

For information on using CMake, see www.cmake.org.

As a Quick Start Guide, on Linux, make a build directory somewhere:

$ cd some_dir
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ccmake <path_to_source_code>

Follow the instructions of 'ccmake' - the CMake "GUI". Then:

$ make
$ make install

On Windows, add a new build folder somewhere. Start the CMake
executable and fill in the paths to the source and build folders. When
you run CMake, a Visual Studio project solution file will be generated
in the build folder.
